# MinHash-Movie-Recommendations

#### Project developed for *Probabilistic Methods for Informatic Engineering* subject.

Using [MovieLens datasets](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), this system is able to recommend and search movies using variations of the MinHash algorithm.

The file `calcs.m` needs to be ran first as it generates preprocessing of the datasets that improves the main application, `menu.m`, performance.
